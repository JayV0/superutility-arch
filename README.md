# Super Utility - ArchLinux

### What is Super Utility?
Super Utility is an bash script that is used to install and configure archlinux

### Installation
The installation side of Super Utility is pretty bear bones its only to get the user to an [xorg](https://x.org) session configured with the [Gnome Desktop Environment](https://gnome.org).

### Configuration
You may be thinking now why the hell would i use this and i understand that but Super Utility isnt meant to install arch it can do it but where it really shines is configuration like:

* Installing Drivers
* Installing Software
* Kernel Switches
* Nvidia
* Setting Game-Ready settings

# Why Super Utility
The reason i created Super Utility is to easly install and configure Arch Linux for me and my classmates i am studying Computer Science at [Summa College](https://summacollege.nl) in [Eindhoven](https://eindhoven.nl), [The Netherlands](https://holland.com) and we have to constantly wipe out our computers for different assignments this takes a lot of time and i also use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) at home and having an fresh installation is very nice so i made this tool because im lazy :)
